# Walkland
This Web App "[Walkland](http://www.cheapwwwbreu.com/)" was created at the Auckland Summer of Tech Hackfest over the weekend of August 8-9 2015 by team Warwick 240. We managed to win 2nd place across 10 teams. *NOTE* - we only had 2 days to develop the app, so naturally some of the code isn't very pretty and many shortcuts were made to have something deliverable by the end of the weekend.

### Our Customers
People that want to discover their city, tourists, trampers and hikers.

### The Problem
Walking track information is available out there, but it is often presented in a manner that some would consider difficult and there is no one single 'go-to' website to find this info - it is scattered across multiple different data sources (some online, some offline).

### Our Solution
[Walkland](http://www.cheapwwwbreu.com/) - a simplistic and visually oriented Web App which provides a simple way to interpret track information provided by Land Information New Zealand(LINZ). We wanted to create an easy to use, intuitive and visually appealing database of walking track, so that Aucklanders could get out and discover what the area has to offer. Our interface is simplistic and visually oriented. When the user sees something that interests them, clicking the photo loads more information about the track (length of the walk, expected completion time, distance from the user) and displays a map of the route. By having such a visually oriented interface, people are influenced and inspired by the things they will see, and with any luck, that will prompt them to go and explore.

Moving forward, we plan to integrate social features such as profiles, ratings and other interactive features to allow users to connect with other like-minded people.
